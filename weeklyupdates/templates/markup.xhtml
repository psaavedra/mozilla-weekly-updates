    <h2>Markdown Details</h2>

    <p>In general, status updates use markdown syntax. See <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">daringfireball.net</a> for details about Markdown.</p>

    <p>The following extras are supported:
      <ul>
	<li>Automatic linkifying: Anything that looks like a link starting with http: or https: will automatically be made into a link.</li>
  <py:if test="mozilla_site">
	<li>Automatic bug linkifying. Things like "bug 12345" will be auto-linked to bugzilla.mozilla.org.</li>
  </py:if>
	<li>Cuddled lists: a new line that starts with a start will be made into a list (normal markdown requires an intermediate blank line).</li>
	<li>Disabled _emphasis_. Because MDN links and code snippets often contain embedded underscores, this was causing confusion and is disabled.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Sometimes, the extensions will cause problems, or there
      may be bugs in the <a href="https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2">python-markdown2</a> parsing module. If the parser throws an exception, this
      site falls back to showing the content as plain text.</p>

    <p>If you encounter a bad parsing behavior, please copy the exact input
      text and paste into a <a href="https://github.com/bsmedberg/mozilla-weekly-updates/issues">github issue</a>.</p>
